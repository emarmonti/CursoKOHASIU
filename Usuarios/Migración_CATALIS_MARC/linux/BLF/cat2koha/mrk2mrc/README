This is a Python class for parsing and producing MARC data.  It reads and
writes both MARC21 format records and records in a mnemonic format very
similar to that used by Terry Reese's MarcEdit.  It hasn't seen a bunch
of testing, but I've used it in some conversion work.

MarcMaker.py and MarcBreaker.py are sample scripts that read the
mnemonic format on standard input and write MARC format on standard
output (vice-versa for MarcBreaker).  They're pretty rough, but they
should give you an idea of how to use the parsers.

Any feedback is appreciated!
